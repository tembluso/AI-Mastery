# 🧠 AI Mastery Journey

This repository documents my **20-week self-designed AI Mastery course**, built week by week with daily exercises and projects.  

The goal: **learn AI from scratch by building, experimenting, and documenting everything**.  
Each week has 6 days of learning (notebooks) + 1 final project (Day 7).

- **Daily notebooks (Day1–Day6):** step-by-step exercises, notes, and experiments.  
- **Day 7 Project:** a small end-to-end project for the week, applying everything learned.  
- **Notes:** sometimes you’ll find `.txt` files with my reflections or explanations. These are part of the journey.

## ✅ Completed Projects

- **Week 1 Project — Titanic Survival Predictor**  
  Logistic Regression model trained on the Titanic dataset, wrapped in a Streamlit web app.  
  - Preprocessing pipeline with `scikit-learn`  
  - Logistic Regression classifier  
  - Streamlit app for interactive predictions

## 🎯 Goals of this repo
- Show my **learning journey** transparently (not just polished code).  
- Build a foundation in AI/ML step by step.  
- Keep a record of every exercise, experiment, and project.  

---

## 🚀 Future
- Weeks 2–20 will include more advanced topics (ML models, deep learning, NLP, etc.).  
- Final weeks will focus on **larger projects** applying everything together.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This repo is a **learning journal**.  
Code may be messy, overly commented, or experimental. That’s intentional — it reflects real learning progress.
