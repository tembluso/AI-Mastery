Scaling = rescaling features to a similar range.

Needed for models where feature magnitude affects training (like linear regression).

Not needed for trees (like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting).

"""
Prepares transformations before fitting models.

All columns are numeric, so you only scale them (important for linear regression).

Tree models don't need scaling, so you'll override this later with passthrough.
