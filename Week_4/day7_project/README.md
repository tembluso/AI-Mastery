# Week 4 Â· Day 7 â€” Mini-Project: Movie Recommender ðŸŽ¬

**Goal:** A small, shipâ€‘able item/userâ€‘based collaborative filtering app on MovieLens 100k.

## Files
- `app.py` â€” Streamlit app.
- `requirements.txt` â€” dependencies to run the app.

## Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
By default, it will try to load local `u.data` and `u.item`. If not present, it fetches them from GroupLens.

## Features
- Itemâ€‘based or userâ€‘based cosine similarity.
- Filter by minimum number of ratings per movie.
- Option to exclude alreadyâ€‘watched items.
- Optional minimum release year filter.
- Cached data loading and similarity computation for speed.

## What I learned
- How to construct a userâ€“item matrix and compute cosine similarities.
- How to turn a notebook prototype into a tiny interactive app.
- Tradeâ€‘offs between itemâ€‘ and userâ€‘based CF (scalability vs personalization).
