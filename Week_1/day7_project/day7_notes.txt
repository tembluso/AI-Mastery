This is the data preprocessing pipeline.
-Why? Because raw Titanic data has problems: missing ages, categories like “sex” that are text, etc. Models need clean numeric input.

-For numeric features (age, fare):

-SimpleImputer(strategy="median") → if there's a missing value, replace it with the median.

-For categorical features (sex, pclass, alone):

-First: SimpleImputer(strategy="most_frequent") → if missing, replace with the most common value.

-Then: OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore") → turn categories into numbers (e.g. male → [1,0], female → [0,1]).

-So preprocess = instructions for how to clean + transform data.


What is a pipeline?

-A Pipeline glues everything together into one object.

-Steps:

-When you call .fit(X_train, y_train):

-First it runs preprocess on your training data (fills missing values, encodes categories).

-Then it trains the logistic regression model (clf) on the transformed data.

-When you call .predict(X_test):

-It runs the same preprocessing on the test set.

-Then uses the trained model to make predictions.

-👉 Why it’s great: you don’t need to remember to manually preprocess new data later — the Pipeline remembers everything.
